# Neural Networks from Scratch

Building neural networks from scratch using only numpy, without the help of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Pytorch. 

This repository holds course assignments from "Artificial Intelligence" taught by Prof. Jaehyeong Sim at Ewha Womans University

## Requirements
Following libraries are needed.
* numpy
```
pip install numpy
```
